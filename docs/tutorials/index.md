# Tutorials

The following tutorials demonstrate how to use kdriver for a variety of real-world web automation tasks, including

- Navigating an infinitely scrolling feed
- Creating user accounts
- Retrieving the results of API requests
- (Soon) Many more!

The tutorials in this documentation use
[example pages from zendriver](https://github.com/stephanlensky/zendriver-examples)
created expressly for demonstration purposes. None of the tutorials send real data or create real accounts on real
websites.

Always exercise caution when applying these techniques to automating live sites. Be a good web citizen! Ensure you do
not make excessive numbers of requests or become a burden for the website owners, or you will quickly find your requests
blocked and your IP banned.
